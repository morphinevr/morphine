> VR Full-body tracking via PS Moves!

## What is this?

Morphine is a new OpenVR full-body tracking solution which aims to use PS Moves, and, possibly other devices, once this project matures enough, in-order to achieve *somewhat* cheap VR full-body tracking.

This project aims to support both Windows and Linux.

## How do I use this?

This project is still in extremely early development, and nowhere close to a usable state. Regardless, once this is usable, a guide will be written.

## Goals

- VR full-body tracking using PS-Moves
- Use any camera for tracking (if it's feasible)
- Automatic camera exposure adjustment
- Automatic calibration
- Fast depth-map calculation (and as a result fast 6-DOF tracking without a depth sensor)
- Good UX / UI for the OpenVR Overlay
- Easy to use
